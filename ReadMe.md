#Notes App
This project is a simple web-based Notes App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes in a user-friendly interface.

##Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: This file contains the structure of the web page. It includes the necessary HTML elements and imports required CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css: The CSS file contains styles for the Notes App interface. It defines the layout, design, and responsiveness of the app.

script.js: The JavaScript file powers the interactivity of the app. It handles the addition, editing, and deletion of notes dynamically.

##Libraries and Dependencies
The project utilizes external libraries and dependencies:

Font Awesome: Used for icons in the app's interface. The icons are imported from the Font Awesome library hosted on a CDN.

Marked.js: A library for parsing Markdown into HTML. It is included via CDN to convert user input (in Markdown format) into HTML for rendering notes.

##Features
Add Note Button: Clicking the "Add note" button triggers the addition of a new note with an editable area.

Note Structure: Each note includes tools for editing and deleting notes. It consists of a main display area and a hidden textarea for editing.

Markdown Support: The app supports Markdown syntax in the textarea. The input is converted to HTML using Marked.js, enabling users to write in Markdown format and see the formatted content in the note.

Edit and Delete: Users can edit notes by toggling between the main display area and the textarea. Notes can be deleted by clicking the delete button associated with each note.

##Styling
The interface is styled using a simple and clean design. It uses the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts and has a responsive layout, adapting to various screen sizes.
